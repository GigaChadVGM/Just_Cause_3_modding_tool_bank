### @files.xml and @tocFiles.xml generator

#### Description
This generator is capable of creating two xml files that contain the relative paths to each file in a folder, including files in its sub-folders, as well as existing external paths.  

These xml files can then be used as a reference for repacking .ee archives using standard JC3 tools.
#### Pros
- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Reduces the time spent on adding files</span>
- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Reduces writing errors</span>
- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Provides a good file sorting </span>

#### Cons
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Less control over the xml file</span>
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Does not handle that much xml error detection atm</span>
#### Other
Does not include .xml files when processing
#### Usage
Use one of the functions in .py scripts
